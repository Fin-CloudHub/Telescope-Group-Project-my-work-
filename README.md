# Telescope-Group-Project-my-work-

My contribution to the telescope group project.  Sangwon has written code and produced the master_bias, along with the master_flat_V, _U, and _B images that are used in this code.
ReducedImages.py takes in the '.fits' files from our observations of two star clusters and some standard stars and produces our reduced exposures and final images, that will then be put through further analysis.
